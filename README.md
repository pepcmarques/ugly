# Boilerplate RN

This is a boilerplate for react-native applications. It uses: expo, react-native-paper, redux, axios (installed but not used yet), expo-router.

# Follow the steps below to use this

1. clone the repository
2. rename directory
3. remove remote
4. add new remote
5. edit app.json (e.g.: app name, scheme, slug, icon, splash)
6. edit app.config.json (e.g.: API links)
7. change colors in `./app/index.js` (see Theming reference)
8. rename reducer to a better name
9. install dependencies (npm -i)
